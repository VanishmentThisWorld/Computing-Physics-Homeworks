This is to simulate ~100 particles moving in a 2D plane.

The particles are released on grid, and the interaction follows Lennard-Jones potential

V(r) = 1/r^12 - 1/r^6

You can change the particle numbers(density), temperature to see the different behaviors.

Radial-Mean-Free path is not included in this code.

And to generate the animation, the livelink to MATLAB is required.
